# Hikes R Us - Cybersecurity Program

### Brief Introduction
Worked as part of a group to develop a 30+ page cybersecurity program for a fictional company, Hikes R Us. The program addressed risk management, system security, compliance, and workforce development, as well as policies for technology use, asset management, and data classification. It also included program monitoring, KPIs, and continuous improvement strategies to ensure ongoing effectiveness.

## Skills Learned
- Designing and documenting organization-wide security programs
- Risk identification, assessment, and mitigation planning
- Policy development for systems, assets, and data
- Aligning programs with compliance frameworks (NIST)
- Establishing monitoring metrics, KPIs, and review cycles
- Workforce training and security awareness integration
